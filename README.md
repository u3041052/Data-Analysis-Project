# Data-Analysis-Project
This is a very brief project on Data Analysis using Python.

## Project Description
The project focuses on analysizing a sales dataset and answering some basic questions regarding it.The project leverages Python libraries like pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, and plotly for various tasks.

## File Structure
- shopping_trends_updated.csv: The original dataset in CSV format.
- shopping_trends_updated.xlsx: The converted dataset in Excel format and I have uploaded this dataset so that you can also do your own analysis.
- README.md: Project documentation and Information.

## Requirements
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

## Setup
1. Install the relevant dependencies
    ```
    pip install pandas numpy seaborn matplotlib plotly openpyxl
    ```
2. Run the python script
   ```
   python salesdataset_analysis.py
   ```
> **Note**: Ensure all dependencies are installed before running the project.

## Analysis
    The script performs the following analyses:
    
    - > Filtering Data
    
    - > Demography related questions
    
    - > Visualizing data using Matplotlib and Seaborn

## Example Visualization 
    Here are few of the examples generated by the analysis:
